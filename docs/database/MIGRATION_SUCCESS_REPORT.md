- `full_backup_20250630_192206.sql` - Complete database backup
- `clean_data_20250630_192206.sql` - Cleaned data for import
- `export_info.env` - Migration metadata
- `migrate_files_20250630_192206.js` - File migration script
- `supabase_schema_20250630_192206.prisma` - Supabase schema verification

## 🔧 Environment Changes

### .env.local Changes:

- **Backup Created:** `.env.local.backup_20250630_192206`
- **Local DATABASE_URL:** Commented out (preserved)
- **New DATABASE_URL:** Now points to Supabase

### Before:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:William1!@localhost:5432/facefusion?schema=public"
```

### After:

```bash
#DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:William1!@localhost:5432/facefusion?schema=public"

# Migrated to Supabase on 20250630_192206
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:FaceSwapPOC2025!Secure@db.yunxidsqumhfushjcgyg.supabase.co:5432/postgres"
```

## ⚠️ Minor Issues Encountered

1. **Database Trigger Warnings:** Some permission warnings for system triggers during data import - these are normal for managed databases and don't affect functionality.

2. **SVG File Upload:** One SVG file (`loader.svg`) couldn't be uploaded due to Supabase Storage MIME type restrictions. This is non-critical.

3. **Schema Differences:** Minor differences detected in schema field mapping - this is expected and doesn't affect functionality.

## ✅ Verification Steps Completed

1. **Database Connection:** ✅ Successfully connected to Supabase
2. **Prisma Schema:** ✅ Applied and verified
3. **Data Import:** ✅ All data imported successfully
4. **File Upload:** ✅ 27/28 files uploaded to Supabase Storage
5. **Application Test:** ✅ App running successfully on localhost:3000
6. **Environment Update:** ✅ Configuration updated and backed up

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions:

1. ✅ **Test Application:** Access http://localhost:3000 and verify functionality
2. ✅ **Database Operations:** Test CRUD operations work correctly
3. 🔄 **File Access:** Verify uploaded files are accessible through the app
4. 🔄 **Storage Integration:** Test file upload/download functionality

### Deployment Preparation:

1. **Update Production Environment:** Use Supabase credentials in production
2. **Vercel Deployment:** Deploy with updated environment variables
3. **DNS/Domain:** Point domain to new deployment
4. **Monitoring:** Set up monitoring for the new infrastructure

### Optional Cleanup:

1. **Local Database:** Can be safely shut down after thorough testing
2. **Backup Retention:** Keep backup files for rollback if needed
3. **Documentation:** Update any deployment documentation
