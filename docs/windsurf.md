# Face Swap POC Documentation

## Project Overview

This is a Proof of Concept (POC) for a face swap application built with Next.js 15.2.4 and TypeScript. The application allows users to swap faces between images while providing a secure and scalable infrastructure.

### Key Features
- Real-time face detection and swapping
- Secure user authentication
- Payment processing for premium features
- Responsive UI with modern design
- Cloud-based image storage

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.2.4, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, React Icons
- **Backend**: Node.js, Prisma ORM, PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js
- **Payments**: Stripe API
- **Image Processing**: Sharp library
- **Build Tools**: Turbopack, ESLint, Prettier

## Core Features

### Face Swap Functionality
- Real-time face detection using advanced algorithms
- Support for multiple image formats (PNG, JPEG, WEBP)
- Batch processing capability
- Preview before final swap
- Undo functionality
- Image quality preservation

### Authentication
- Multi-factor authentication
- Role-based access control
- Session management
- Password strength requirements
- Social login integration

### Payment Integration
- Stripe integration with subscription plans
- Secure payment processing
- Automatic renewal handling
- Usage-based billing
- Free tier with limited features
- Premium features unlock with subscription

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- PostgreSQL
- Stripe account
- Next.js CLI

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure environment variables
4. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Security Considerations

### Image Processing
- Rate limiting for face swap requests
- Image validation and sanitization
- Secure storage of processed images
- CORS policies implementation

### Authentication
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt
- JWT-based authentication
- Session management
- CSRF protection

## Performance Optimizations

### Image Processing
- Lazy loading for heavy components
- Caching for processed images
- Optimized image compression
- Parallel processing capabilities

### Frontend
- Code splitting
- Image optimization
- Server-side rendering
- Client-side caching

## Code Quality

### Development Tools
- ESLint for code linting
- Prettier for code formatting
- TypeScript for type safety
- Dependency management

### Testing
- Unit tests for core functionality
- End-to-end testing
- Performance benchmarks
- API testing
