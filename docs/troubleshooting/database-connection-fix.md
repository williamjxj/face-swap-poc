# Database Connection Fix Summary

## Issues Found and Resolved

### 1. Missing DIRECT_URL Environment Variable

**Problem**: The Prisma schema required `DIRECT_URL` but it wasn't defined in `.env`
**Solution**: Added `DIRECT_URL` to `.env` file

### 2. Incorrect Database Port

**Problem**: Scripts were testing port 5432 (direct connection) which is blocked by Supabase
**Solution**: Updated to use port 6543 (connection pooling) which works correctly

### 3. Shell Script Issues

**Problem**: The bash script was using `npx prisma db execute` without proper environment setup
**Solution**:

- Added `DIRECT_URL` environment variable setting
- Implemented direct `psql` connection testing for more reliable results
- Added better error reporting

### 4. Incorrect Password Testing

**Problem**: Scripts were testing with wrong password `William1!`
**Solution**: Removed incorrect password tests, focused on correct password `FaceSwapPOC2025!Secure!`

## Working Configuration

### .env file:

```bash
# Database URL for Prisma (Cloud Supabase) - Using connection pooling port 6543
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:FaceSwapPOC2025!Secure!@db.yunxidsqumhfushjcgyg.supabase.co:6543/postgres"
# Direct URL for connection pooling (Supabase uses port 6543 for pooling)
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://postgres:FaceSwapPOC2025!Secure!@db.yunxidsqumhfushjcgyg.supabase.co:6543/postgres"
```

## Test Results

### Working URLs:

1. ✅ `postgresql://postgres:FaceSwapPOC2025!Secure!@db.yunxidsqumhfushjcgyg.supabase.co:6543/postgres`
2. ✅ `postgresql://postgres:FaceSwapPOC2025%21Secure%21@db.yunxidsqumhfushjcgyg.supabase.co:6543/postgres` (URL encoded)

### Failed URLs:

1. ❌ Port 5432 - Connection refused (direct connection blocked)
2. ❌ Escaped characters `\!` - SASL authentication failed
3. ❌ Wrong password `William1!` - Authentication failed

## Key Learnings

1. **Supabase Connection Pooling**: Always use port 6543 for Supabase cloud connections
2. **Password Format**: Unescaped exclamation marks work fine: `FaceSwapPOC2025!Secure!`
3. **URL Encoding**: Both unescaped (`!`) and URL-encoded (`%21`) work
4. **Prisma Requirements**: Both `DATABASE_URL` and `DIRECT_URL` are required

## Verification Commands

Test the connection:

```bash
# Run the shell script
./scripts/test-database-urls.sh

# Run the JavaScript version
node scripts/test-database-urls.js

# Test with Prisma
npx prisma db execute --stdin --schema=prisma/schema.prisma <<< "SELECT 1;"
```

## Notes

- The "prepared statement already exists" error with connection pooling is normal and doesn't indicate a connection problem
- For production, always use connection pooling (port 6543) for better performance
- Ensure your IP is whitelisted in Supabase project settings if connecting from a new location
