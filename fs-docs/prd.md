# Product Requirements Document: Core User Experience Enhancements

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines key requirements for improving the user experience related to user authentication and video processing within the application.

## 2. Goals
*   To provide flexible and user-friendly authentication options.
*   To enhance user confidence and understanding during video loading processes.
*   To significantly improve the performance of video loading.

## 3. Features & Requirements

### 3.1. User Authentication

*   **ID:** `AUTH-001`
*   **Feature:** Flexible User Registration and Login
*   **Description:**
    Users should be able to create an account and log in to the application using standard email registration or by leveraging existing Google or Microsoft accounts for a streamlined experience.
*   **Requirements/Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Users can register using any valid email address and a chosen password.
    *   Users can initiate registration and login using their Google account (OAuth 2.0).
    *   Users can initiate registration and login using their Microsoft account (OAuth 2.0).
*   **Priority:** High

### 3.2. Video Handling & User Experience

*   **ID:** `VID-UX-001`
*   **Feature:** Visual Feedback for Video Loading
*   **Description:**
    When a video is being loaded or processed, the user must be clearly informed of this activity through visual cues. This is to prevent users from assuming the application is unresponsive or has encountered an error.
*   **Requirements/Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   A visible loading indicator (e.g., spinner, progress bar, or custom animation) must be displayed immediately when a video starts loading/processing.
    *   The loading indicator should remain active and visible until the video is ready for interaction or an error state is explicitly shown.
    *   The design of the indicator should be intuitive and clearly convey an active process.
*   **Rationale:**
    Improves user experience by providing transparency about system status, reducing frustration and perceived failures.
*   **Priority:** High

*   **ID:** `VID-PERF-001`
*   **Feature:** Optimized Video Loading Performance
*   **Description:**
    The time required for loading videos needs to be drastically reduced. Current loading times, where a 2-3 second video can take minutes to load, are unacceptable and severely impact usability.
*   **Requirements/Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   The loading time for short videos (e.g., 2-3 seconds in duration) must be significantly reduced from minutes to a few seconds.
    *   Performance targets should be established for various video lengths and common network conditions.
    *   The system should be optimized to ensure efficient processing and delivery of video content.
*   **Rationale:**
    Long loading times lead to user abandonment and a poor overall perception of the application's quality and performance.
*   **Priority:** Critical

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **NFR-001: Usability:**
    *   The login process should be intuitive and straightforward.
    *   Feedback mechanisms (like loading indicators) should be clear and unambiguous.
*   **NFR-002: Performance:**
    *   Video loading times must meet the targets defined in `VID-PERF-001`.
    *   The application should remain responsive during video loading processes.

## 5. Future Considerations (Out of Scope for this iteration)
*   Detailed error handling messages for video loading failures.
*   Advanced video editing features post-loading.

**Summary of Input (Original Notes):**
*   LOGIN - You can register with any email address or directly with Google/Microsoft.
*   WHEN LOADING A VIDEO - SHOW THAT IT IS LOADING WITH AN ICON OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO THAT THE USER DOESN'T THINK IT'S NOT LOADING OR HAS FAILED.
*   Try to ensure that it doesn't take too long to load, since a 2-3 second video takes minutes to load.
